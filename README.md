This theme is based on [Atom's starter template](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template) for UI themes. I tried to keep diffs small to keep this theme in sync with the original (as it's the cleanest and the most reliable theme I ever tried).

## Installation
Search for `minima-gp-ui` in **Settings > Install**.

Or install via `apm`:

```shell
apm install minima-gp-ui
```

Works best with [`minima-syntax`](https://atom.io/packages/minima-syntax).
